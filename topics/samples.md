## Project management

A _project_ is a task with a unique requirement to achieve a desired result. It could be as simple a project as making a model of a building, or a more complex project of designing an aircraft simulator.

A software project can be divided into several stages of development:

- Planning the project including estimation of effort
- Reviewing and revisiting the project plan to assess the priorities during planning meeting
- Creating the prototype
- Providing demo of the prototype
- Implementing the improvement sugggestions and merging the changes
- Proceeding similarly with all planned features until the end of all planned iterations
- Holding a system demo
- Conducting the release milestone meeting

There are several tools and processes that help up to carry out all project status tracking tasks. The most frequently used tool across several enterprises is the Altassian's JIRA.
